# Simple Xbox Controller Adapter - Overview

## Purpose

This is a 'work in progress' adaptation of Ryzee119's excellent [four-way wired/wireless controller adapter](https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/) to allow the use of Xbox One and Xbox 360 controllers on an original Xbox console. 

The objectives of this project are:
* The simplest possible harware build, using only off-the-shelf parts (ideally an Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro paired with a generic USB Host Shield). 
* Initially, simple (through-hole/jumper pad only) soldering. It later became clear a no solder version is possible if using the right brand of USB Host Shield. 
* Reduced, simpler code to make playing around with it as straightforward as possible.
* Reduced functionality, reflecting the simpler code - it will be wired-only and not offer Steel Batallion support. 
* Eventually (I hope) allow for use of a wider range of controllers.
* To provide full, foolproof instructions to enable anyone who's broadly comfortable with an Arduino to put together an adapter and anyone who is broadly comfortable with the command line and IDEs to edit and build the code. So this document is a key part of the project.

This started when I dusted off my old Xbox and wanted to make something to use newer (and I'll just say it - better) controllers with it. There's plenty of previous work on this and as I develop this document I'll link to more and more of it, but even with some experience of AVR and PIC programming it was a bit of a slog working out how to do this. The two biggest barriers were the complexity of some of the projects out there and/or getting them to build using reliable, free/open-source tools.

A significant factor in basing this project on ogx360 rather than XBOXPadMicro/XInput (see below) was that it was possible (for me) to clone, edit, extend and build without too much fighting with build tools/IDEs etc. That being said, the ogx360 project was originally built in Atmel/Microchip Studio which is Windows only (I could have lived with this) but kept causing my mouse pointer to stall every 60 seconds (I really coulndn't) because it apparently [fears some USB mice](https://www.avrfreaks.net/forum/mouse-pointer-stutters-when-connecting-usb-devices-while-running) in much the same way as [Les fears chives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjxPaCnIVdM&t=2m15s). This project uses VS Code.


## Current State

Release 1.0 is basically a pared back version of ogx360. The differences are

## Alternatives & other things to look at

* [Ryzee119's ogx360 project](https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/), on which this is based.
    * Uses up to four Arduino Pro Micros to provide up to four emulated original Xbox controllers, connected via a custom PCB to a MAX3421 USB Host Controller IC (the same IC used in Arduino USB Host Shields).
    * Unfortunately, the MAX3421 is not (to the very best of my knowledge) available in a through-hole package making it tough work for a hobby project. Some people laugh in the face of surface mount soldering; I am not amongst them. 
* [Another Ryzee199 project](https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360_t4) pretty much meets the aims of this one (simple, no soldering, other controller support) but relies on the [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html). This works with the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO etc but is a more expensive option, reflecting the fact the board has an integral USB host, SD card, ethernet support etc and a 32bit processor. But very straightforward.
* [The XBOXPadMicro project](https://github.com/bootsector/XBOXPadMicro) allows for a customised controller to be built to work with a classic Xbox Console, using an Arduino's digital input pins. 
    * Doesn't include any USB host functionality, so you can't plug another controller into it. It has everything you need to build/adapt a custom controller, however. I intend to use this to get a [TAC-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAC-2) working with PC/Xbox. 
    * It's written in C and would need some work to adapt it for use with the broader Arduino ecosystem, allowing it to be adapted for use with USB controllers.
* [The Arduino XInput library](https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput) has everything needed to build a project to make an Arduino appear as an Xinput controller (the protocol used by the Xbox, successor consoles and Windows) except the vendor-specific HID challenge/response code needed to work with an actual Xbox console. So it will work with Windows/Linux/Mac but not the console itself.
* This project and both of Ryzee119's use the [Arduino USB Host Shield Library](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0) to handle communication between the device and the Xbox One/360 controller. The speed with which you can pick up an Arduino, a shield and have a PS4/Xbox One/360/etc controller talking to Linux/Windows/Mac via serial is really impressive. It's well supported and has support for a wide range of USB controllers, including great example sketches.

## Quickest and easiest way to get an Xbox One/360 pad working with an original Xbox right now!

As I started to understand the ogx360 project it became clear that the custom PCB isn't needed - it will work with a Leonardo, paired with a USB Host Shield, with no modifications to the code. An aim of this project is to make building an adapter with just these two things foolproof but for now...

* Buy an Arduino Leonardo and USB Host Shield. Make sure the Shield is set up for 5V on the USB bus (it may be already) and plug them together.
* Download 'ogx360_32u4_master.hex' from https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/releases
* Burn the hex to the Leonardo using the method under 'Programming' [here](https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360/releases) (Windows) or the Linux instructions towards the end of this document. You can't just use the normal Arduino IDE method but don't be put off. It's easy and no special hardware is needed.

There are variations on this (a Pro Micro can stand in for a Leonardo, you can use a shield designed for the Pro Mini etc) but this is the simplest.

# Getting Started

There isn't a release yet though using the instructions below to build commit 9d2a5b2 works (tested in Unreal 2, on an original Xbox, with an Xbox One controller).

These instructions are for Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distro) and MacOS (tested on Catalina). Windows instructions to follow.

What you'll need in add:
* An Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro (explanation to follow on why not an Uno/Mini/other) and USB cable to connect it
* An Arduino USB Host Shield, connected to the Arduino (...you guessed it...details to follow)

## Install Command Line Tools

### Ubuntu etc
* From a command prompt run: 
```
sudo apt-get install avrdude gcc-avr gdb-avr binutils-avr avr-libc git build-essential cmake
```

### MacOS
* From a command prompt run:
```
xcode-select â€”-install
brew tap osx-cross/avr
brew install avr-gcc avrdude cmake
```
## Install VS Code

The project uses CMake to build itself from the three libraries (Arduino, LUFA, USB Host Shield) and project code. VS Code's CMake extension can run the right CMake tasks automatically every time the project is opened.

* Download and install Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* Open VS Code, click on the 'extensions' icon on the left hand side and install the 'C/C++' and 'CMake Tools' extensions.
* Close VS Code.
* Clone this project to an appropriate location with 'git clone https://github.com/jimnarey/SimpleXboxControllerAdapter'
* Open VS Code again and select 'File -> Open Folder'. Point it to the cloned repo.
* If asked about which compiler to use, via a drop-down box, select gcc-avr
* The CMake Tools extension should now create a 'build' directory within the 'Firmware' directory. Click 'yes' if it asks for permission to do this and click 'yes' if it asks about running Cmake each time a project/folder is opened.
* Open main.cpp. If there are red squiggles under any of the header file/other names (meaning VS Code doesn't know where the files are located):
    * Open the VS Code command palette with Ctrl-Shift-P and type 'edit'. 
    * An option entitled 'C/C++ Edit Configurations UI' should appear. Select it. 
    * Scroll down to the 'Include Path' section and in the box below add the path to the AVR libraries. 
        * On Ubuntu 20 this is '/usr/lib/avr/include' but running ```dpkg -L avr-libc | grep include``` will give you the right path on any Debian-based system.
        * On MacOS, this will depend on the version of the AVR compiler installed by brew. On Catalina and avr-gcc 9.3.0, the correct path is '/usr/local/Cellar/avr-gcc/9.3.0/avr/include/'.
* You should now have everything up and running to play around with the code and build it.

## Build

* Enter the 'build' directory created by VS Code/CMake Tools.
* Type `make` to build the project. It will create .elf file, containing the firmware to be burned onto an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro but not yet in the correct format. As things stand this is called 'ogx360_32u4_master.elf'.
* MacOS/Brew, which uses a newer version of gcc-avr than Ubuntu, will likely throw some warnings when compiling the LUFA library. These can be ignored.
* Enter 
```
avr-objcopy -O binary ogx360_32u4_master.elf ./ogx360_32u4_master.bin
```
to create file we can burn to the Arduino
* Open another terminal window and enter 'dmesg -wH' to provide dmesg output on a rolling basis.
* In the original terminal window (which you just used to run avr-objcopy) enter the following command, but don't hit 'Enter'.

Linux:
```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c avr109 -U flash:w:ogx360_32u4_master.bin -C /etc/avrdude.conf'
```
MacOS [to do - test this]
```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c avr109 -U flash:w:ogx360_32u4_master.bin -C /usr/local/Cellar/avrdude/6.3_1/etc/avrdude.conf'
```
## Burn

We need to use avrdude for this and we need to make sure that the bootloader/firmware section of the Arduino's program memory is flashed rather than the normal 'sketch' space addressed by the Arduino IDE. This is essential to enabling the device to appear as a HID(-like) device rather than a serial device. Whatever code you flash to an Arduino with the IDE, it always appears to a connected host (i.e a PC) as a serial device, as this is a feature of the pre-flashed bootloader.

No special hardware (e.g. a progammer is needed).

Performing this process successfully *ought* not prevent flashing the standard Arduino bootloader back onto the device using USB (no special hardware is needed), however I haven't tested this yet. 

If something goes wrong, you may need to reflash the Arduino using a hardware programmer, which can be as simple as another properly configured Arduino. I have tested this, after running an incorrect avrdude command.

For the time being, these instructions are for Linux...

* Plug in the Arduino as you would normally. You'll see some dmesg output about it being connected. 
* Press the reset button on the Arduino or if using a Pro Micro, short the RST and GND pins twice in immediate sucession. When the dmesg output shows the Arduino as disconnected, then immediately reconnected, hit 'Enter' in the other window. If you get this wrong you'll need another Arduino or hardware programmer to fix it (search for burning Ardunio bootloaders using an Arduino as an ISP).
